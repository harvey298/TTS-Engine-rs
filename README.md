# Simple TTS Engine

This is for very simplistic TTS, try not to use this in production as its very unstable!

Usage:
`
    tts_engine::engines::tiktok::run("Your Text","output file", "voice").await
`

# Why?
if people want to use theses TTS engines in Rust without having to spend the item figuring it out and providing support


# Disclaimer 
Tiktok no longer works due to the api being moved and private!
This means tiktok won't be maintained until a new api url is found
And I need to rewrite this
